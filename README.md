## Objective was to create a search module that uses the binary search method, also known as the half-interval search.
### To show the effiency the binary search method has over a traditional "linear search" method
### I added a **halving counter** and an **elapsed time count** as quantitative metrics.




### The binary search algorithm finds the position of a target value within a sorted array by repeatedly dividing in half
### the portion of the list that could contain the item, until you've narrowed down the possible locations to just one.
